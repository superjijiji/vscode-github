<div>
	The <strong>My Cognos schedules - Manage folders</strong> page enables
	you to create and manage a series of folders to help organise the
	Cognos trigger-based schedule requests (CSRs) that you have created.
	&nbsp;
</div>
<br />
<p>
	The Manage folders page allows you to:<br />
<ul>
	<li>Create new folders or rename them</li>
	<li>Place CSRs into the folders you have created</li>
	<li>Delete folders you have altready created</li>
	<li>Sequence folders and associated CSRs to place them in your
		preferred order</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Creating a new folder</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Enter the desired folder name in the text box and then click on the <strong>Create
		folder</strong> button to create the new folder. To rename an existing folder,
	highlight the folder to be renamed and then type the new name in the
	text box before clicking on the <strong>Rename folder</strong> button.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Moving Cognos Schedule Requests into a folder</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Locate the CSRs you wish to move, select them and then drag them to the
	target folder. A green check mark will indicate when they can be
	dropped in place. Alternatively, select the reports you want to move
	and then click on the <strong> Move selected</strong> button. A dialog
	will open prompting you to select the target destination folder. To
	help you identify the correct requests, each CSR is identified by a
	text string comprised of the report name, the CSR comments and the
	e-Mail subject separated by the | character.
</p>
<p>
	The on-page <strong>Search</strong> function can be useful in helping
	identify candidate requests. Just type the desired text string in the
	Search box to restrict the display to all entries containing that
	string. Note that the search function will also find matching CSRs
	within existing folders even when closed. The <strong>Check /
		Uncheck all</strong> button will toggle between selecting and deselecting all
	displayed CSRs prior to initiating the <strong>Move selected</strong>
	request.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Deleting a folder</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Highlight the folder you wish to remove and then click on the <strong>Delete
		folder</strong> button. Note that only the folder will be removed - the actual
	CSRs will remain on the system.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Changing the display order of folders and CSRs</strong>
</p>
<p>
	To re-sequence folders or change the display order of CSRs within a
	folder highlight the desired content and then drag and drop it in the
	new location. A green check mark will indicate when they can be dropped
	in place. Note that you can use the <strong>Expand all</strong> and <strong>Collapse
		all</strong> buttons to control how these folders appear. Further changes to
	the order in which your Cognos Schedule Requests are displayed may be
	made by using the sort function in the My Cognos Schedules page. Simply
	click on the column headings to sort by that particular column. Note
	that browser cookies will retain this sort order next time you open the
	My Cognos schedules page
</p>

	<br>&nbsp;<strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong> - You must click on the
	<strong>Save changes</strong> button before clicking on the <strong>
		Back </strong> link to return the My Cognos schedules page. <br>&nbsp;
