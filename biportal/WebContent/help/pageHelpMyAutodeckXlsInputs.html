	The <strong>Manage xls inputs</strong> page enables you to:
	<ol>
		<li>Upload xls/xlsx files that are to be used as part of your
			Autodeck definitions.</li>
		<li>Replace an existing uploaded file with new content.</li>
		<li>Extend the expiration date of an existing uploaded file.</li>
		<li>Remove any uploaded files that are no longer needed on the
			system.</li>
	</ol>

	<p><strong>USAGE TIP</strong> If you wish to use your uploaded file to manipulate content from other pages in your
	generated Autodeck (Excel format) you must include the string <strong>(KeepLinks)</strong> in the worksheet name(s).
	This will instruct the Autodeck process to retain references to cells from the selected TBS inputs
	on other worksheets in your Autodeck output.
	Note that in some circumstances you may need to <strong>Change Source...</strong> by using the
	<strong>Edit Links</strong> Excel function to restablish the linkage in the generated Autodeck output file.</p>
