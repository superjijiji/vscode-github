	The <strong>Cognos Schedule Status</strong> page helps you understand
	the <strong>current state</strong> of all requested Cognos inputs for
	the selected <strong>Active</strong> Autodeck definition. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
	In addition to showing the date and time (GMT) that the last <strong>Final</strong>
	deck was produced, this page provides a table of the associated
	Autodeck inputs with the following information: &nbsp;<br>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Report Name</strong> - provides a link to the most
			recent Cognos Schedule Request (CSR) output file.</li>
		<li><strong>e-Mail Subject</strong> - shows the text that will
			appear as the Subject line when the report output is mailed to its
			target recipients.</li>
		<li><strong>Frequency</strong> - shows the days of the week that
			the schedule <strong>can</strong> be triggered. Note that the report
			will only run on these days regardless of when the trigger is
			actually received.</li>
		<li><strong>Ready for Final Deck</strong> - indicates whether the
			Autodeck inputs are currently ready for a Final deck to be created:
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Ready</strong> - the CSR has been updated since the
					last Final Autodeck was produced</li>
				<li><strong>Failed</strong> - the last attempt to run this CSR
					failed.</li>
				<li><strong>Unavailable</strong> - a new CSR input that has
					never been run.</li>
				<li><strong>Not Ready</strong> - the CSR has not been updated
					since the last Final Autodeck was produced.</li>
				<li><strong>Inactive</strong> - the CSR has been set to
					Inactive state and will not be triggered.</li>
				<li><strong>Suspend</strong> - BI@IBM administrators have
					stopped this report from running due to system issues.</li>
				<li><strong>Deleted</strong> - the CSR can no longer be run as
					the report is no longer available</li>
			</ul> Note that immediately after the Autodeck is run, all inputs will
			normally show <strong>Not Ready</strong> unless one or more have been
			run again in the intervening period.</li>
		<li><strong>Execution Status</strong> - information regarding the
			status of most recent attempt to run this schedule request:
			<ul>
				<li>100 - Report ran successfully.</li>
				<li>101 - Report ran and sent out mail successfully.</li>
				<li>200 - Report failed to run successfully.</li>
				<li>300 - Report is running.</li>
				<li>400 - Timeout</li>
			</ul>
		<li><strong>Comments</strong> - text added as comments on the
			edit prompts page when you set the schedule request up. This
			information helps you distinguish between multiple schedules for the
			same report.</li>
		<li><strong>Last Update Time</strong> - shows the date and time
			(GMT) when the schedule was last run.</li>
		<li><strong>Request ID</strong> - the unique BI@IBM identifier
			for the specified Cognos Schedule Request.</li>
