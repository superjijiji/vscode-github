but to do the following as well:
&nbsp;<br>
<ol>

		<li>Display key information about the report in the search results page.</li>
		<li>Display all the available prompts in the search results page.</li>
		<li>Allows you to do a TBS schedule.</li>
		<li>Add any report to a favorites section for each access.</li>
		<li>Rank the report based on pre-defined parameters.</li>
		<li>Add comments and share thoughts.</li>
</ol>


&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Few suggested methods below to retrieve the reports information: </strong>
	<ul>
		<li><strong> fuzzy search </strong> - the easiest way when you do not know the report ID but know the key words of the report name. 
		By entering the key words in search box, cognitive search will check for the matching results and displays it on your screen.
		&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
			
		( Product Owner Comments: Do not think the word search is working as expected, kindly check before we include this in FAQs )
		</li>
		&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
		<li><strong> '* ' search</strong> - helps when the user is unaware of the full report name, user is required to include '*' for the missing words.
		<br>
		Example: *SMS9388* will pull all the matching results that could have some beginning or ending words.
		&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
		
		( Product Owner Comments: Do not think the '*' search is working as expected, kindly check before we include this in FAQs )
		</li>
		&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
		<li><strong>Case sensertivity</strong> - you can put the words in search box with case sensitivity.
		<br>
		Example:
		<br>
		capital letters: 
		<br>
		<img src="../images/capital_letters.png" width="900" height="165"/>
		<br>
		lower letters: 
		<br>
		<img src="../images/lower_letters.png" width="900" height="260"/>
		 </li>
		&nbsp;<br>
		<li><strong> Exact matching search</strong> -It helps only when you know the complete report name. 
		Since the report names are not duplicate, the results page would provide you with unique matching results. 
		&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
		( Product Owner Comments: Do not think the Exact matching search is working as expected, kindly check before we include this in FAQs )
		</li>
	</ul>

&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
Besides doing a basic search, it will also display - <strong> available prompt selections and Key report information</strong> about each matching result. 
This provides users with more insights about a report with out really running each matching result. 
Each matching result is prefixed with a twisty (+) which user can expand by clicking on it to see the prompts and key information.
