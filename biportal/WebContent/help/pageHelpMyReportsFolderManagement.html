<div>
	The <strong>My reports - Manage folders</strong> page enables
	you to create and manage a series of folders to help organise the
	Cognos reports that you have bookmarked.
	&nbsp;
</div>
<br />
<p>
	The Manage folders page allows you to:<br />
<ul>
	<li>Create new folders or rename them</li>
	<li>Place cognos reports into the folders you have created</li>
	<li>Delete folders you have already created</li>
	<li>Sequence folders</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Creating a new folder</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Enter the desired folder name in the text box and then click on the <strong>Create
		folder</strong> button to create the new folder. To rename an existing folder,
	highlight the folder to be renamed and then type the new name in the
	text box before clicking on the <strong>Rename folder</strong> button.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Moving Cognos reports into a folder</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Locate the reports you wish to move, select them and then drag them to the
	target folder. A green check mark will indicate when they can be
	dropped in place. Alternatively, select the reports you want to move
	and then click on the <strong> Move selected</strong> button. A dialog
	will open prompting you to select the target destination folder. 
</p>
<p>
	The on-page <strong>Search</strong> function can be useful in helping
	identify candidate reports. Just type the desired text string in the
	Search box to restrict the display to all entries containing that
	string. Note that the search function will also find matching reports 
	within existing folders even when closed. The <strong>Check /
		Uncheck all</strong> button will toggle between selecting and deselecting all
	displayed reports prior to initiating the <strong>Move selected</strong>
	request.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Deleting a folder</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Highlight the folder you wish to remove and then click on the <strong>Delete
		folder</strong> button. Note that only the folder will be removed - the actual
	reports will remain on the system.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Changing the display order of folders</strong>
</p>
<p>
	To re-sequence folders, drag and drop it in the
	new location. A green check mark will indicate when they can be dropped
	in place. Note that you can use the <strong>Expand all</strong> and <strong>Collapse
		all</strong> buttons to control how these folders appear. 
</p>
<p>
	<br>&nbsp;<strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong> - You must click on the
	<strong>Save changes</strong> button before clicking on the <strong>
		Back </strong> link to return the BI@IBM Portal page. <br>&nbsp;
