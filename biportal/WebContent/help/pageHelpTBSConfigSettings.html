<div>
    The <strong>TBS configuration settings</strong> page shows the current set of reports associated with each of
    the available configuration options. &nbsp;
    <br>&nbsp;
    <br> Click on the relevant tab to view the currently available information:
    <ul>
        <li>Report chaining - automated schedule creation for linked reports</li>
        <li>Off-peak execution - associated schedules will only be run outside periods of peak loading</li>
        <li>Suspended reports - prompt selections must be updated before the associated schedule will be run again</li>
        <li>Disabled reports - underlying reports are being removed and all associated schedule requests must be deleted</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By default, each page will display 10 entries but this can be changed if desired by using the drop-down menu.
    (The system will remember your selection and apply it next time you open the <strong>TBS configuration
    settings</strong> page).
    To navigate through the pages click on the relevant page number at the bottom of the display area.
    Alternatively, the on-page search function can be used to modify the displayed content to show the subset of the
    entire data set that contains the specified text string.</p>
    <p>Please note that individual reports will continue to be listed on the Suspended and Disabled tabs
    while there is at least one such remaining Cognos Schedule Request defined on the system.</p>
