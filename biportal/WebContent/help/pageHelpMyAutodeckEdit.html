					<br />The <strong>Edit requests</strong> tab enables you to select
					any available Excel input files to be included in your presentation
					deck. These may be previously scheduled trigger-based Cognos report
					output files in xls or xlsx format, or any other Excel files you
					have uploaded to the system directly using the <strong>Manage
						xls inputs</strong> function of the <strong>My Autodeck schedules</strong>
					page.
					<p>The <strong>Request Status</strong> column shows the current status information for each TBS input request.
					Note that entries in <strong>Disabled</strong> state will not be included in your generated Autodeck
					and should be deleted.
					Additional columns show whether the required TBS input file is available and when the associated schedule was last run.
					Links are provided on the <strong>Report Name / File Name</strong> column that open the associated Cognos Schedule
					Request and you can also download the latest TBS output file for all inputs in <strong>Ready</strong> state by clicking
					on the <strong>Request ID</strong>.
					</p>
					<p>By default, the entire content from each file will be
					included in your Autodeck in the sequence you set here, with each
					worksheet and chart for the input files placed on a new page (slide
					or worksheet). Once the Autodeck has been successfully created for
					the first time, the <strong>Configuration template</strong> tab
					will appear. This tab provides you with access to a wide range of
					functions to override the default system-generated layout.</p>
				</div>
				<ul>
					<li><strong><u>Move up</u> / <u>Move down</u> </strong>: use
						the check box to select the required inputs and then click on
						these 'action' links to change the default order of the content in
						your generated deck.</li>
					<li><strong><u>Select more</u> </strong>: use this link to add
						additional content to your deck. In the new window, click on the <strong>Cognos
							schedule request</strong> or <strong>Uploaded files</strong> tab to locate
						your desired content. Click on the <strong><u>Add</u> </strong>
						links to append your desired additions to the presentation deck
						and then close the window to return to the main panel where you
						can adjust the sequence of the new pages.</li>
					<li><strong><u>Delete</u> </strong>: use the check boxes and
						then click on this link to remove any redundant content.</li>
					<li><strong><u>Reset Output Status</u></strong>: use the check boxes and then click on this link to toggle between <strong>Ready</strong>
					and <strong>Not Ready</strong> Output status on the selected TBS inputs.
					This helps you to resync the TBS inputs when using the <strong>When Ready (recommended for Daily decks)</strong> Final deck synchronisation option.</li>
					<li><strong><u>Work with associated Schedule Requests</u></strong>: use this to open a 'folder' view of the Cognos Schedule Requests
					associated with this Autodeck.
					From this new panel you can use any of the standard My Cognos Schedule functions (e.g. Bulk update, Run now, Extend date) on the CSRs
					used in your Autodeck.</li>
				</ul> <strong>IMPORTANT NOTE: once you edit the Configuration
					template, the content and order of the selected inputs on the Edit
					requests tab will have no bearing on the layout of the generated
					Autodeck unless you also use the 'Request reset' button to reset
					your customised Configuration template back to the system default
					which will then be recreated based on the order and content
					currently specified on the Edit requests tab.</strong> <!-- BACK TO TOP -->

					may also opt to <strong>Append date</strong> information to the
					file name to help distinguish weekly Autodeck outputs. If you

					provided date information formats.
				</div> <br /> Three Autodeck output file types are available:
				<ul>
					<li>xls - MS Excel 97-2003 Workbook;</li>

					<li><strong>e-Mail subject</strong>: This is a required field.
						Type the text to display in the subject line of the e-Mail.<br>
						<strong>Note</strong>: It is recommended that you use this field
						to make it easy to identify this Autodeck request in your mail.</li>
					<li><strong>e-Mail content:</strong> This is an optional
						field. Type information about the presentation deck that you want
						to include in the body of the e-Mail message.</li>
					<li><strong>Backup</strong>: Specify the intranet ID of the
						user who you want to act as the backup owner (editor) of this
						Autodeck definition. This is an optional field.</li>

				</div> <br />

					Your Autodeck will be created as soon as all the criteria for the Autodeck creation have been met.
					The requested inputs must be available and have been updated since the specified day / time (Weekly Autodecks)
					or since the last <strong>Final</strong> deck was produced (Daily Autodecks).
					The <strong>Submit now</strong> button on the <strong>My Autodeck schedules - Existing Autodecks</strong>
					page allows you to trigger an immediate Autodeck generation regardless of the readiness state of the TBS inputs.
					Note that xls uploads are not checked for updates and will be used in their current state as soon as all
					other inputs are available.<br> <br>
					The <strong>Schedule tab</strong> information is used to control the <strong>synchronisation</strong>
					of the content required in your Final deck and the timing for
					status message updates and Provisional presentation deck creation
					if requested. Please complete all the following required fields:
				</div> <br />
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Final deck Synchronisation</strong>: choose from
						one of the following two options to control the timing of your <strong>Final</strong>
						Autodeck creation:
						<ol>
						<li><strong>Day/Time</strong> - the Autodeck will be created
							when all required inputs are updated <strong>again AFTER</strong> the chosen day and time.
							<br>
							<strong>Note: This is the recommended option for Weekly Autodecks and is now the default for all newly created Autodeck schedules.
							For weekly cadence reports you should choose 'Wednesday' and a time a few hours prior to earliest update time for the data your
							reports rely on.</li></strong><br>
							<li><strong>When Ready</strong> - the Autodeck will be created
							when all required inputs are <strong>NEXT</strong> updated, regardless of when that happens.
							<br>
							<strong>Important notes for option #2 (When Ready): </strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Until the Autodeck has been generated at least once, the only available readiness states are 'Ready' and 'Unavailable' -
								the additional 'Not Ready' designation can only appear after the generation process has completed.
								The <strong>Output Status</strong> and <strong>Last Ready Time</strong> information is shown on the <strong>Edit requests</strong> tab of the
								<strong>Existing Autodecks</strong> pages.</li>
								<li>If your Autodeck relies on content that is scheduled to be produced
								on different days of the week, you need to be very careful about
								the day you initially submit your request, as this will determine
								when subsequent decks are created. For example, consider a simple
								deck that uses an input (A) created on a Tuesday and another (B)
								that is created on Thursday each week. If the user wants the
								Autodeck to contain information from the same week, the schedule
								should be submitted after report B has been updated and before
								report A is re-triggered (e.g. on Friday). If the deck was created
								between the refresh cycles of reports A and B (e.g. on Wednesday),
								the Autodeck would always contain the current week content for
								report A and the prior week content for report B.</li>
								<li>The <strong>Reset Output Status</strong> function on the Edit Requests tab of your Existing Autodeck definitions
								allows you correct this and resync the TBS inputs by toggling
								between the <strong>Ready</strong> and <strong>Not Ready</strong> states for the selected TBS input(s) if necessary.</li>
							</li>
						</ol>
					<li><strong>Status Messages / Provisional Decks</strong>: Use the menu selection list to control any additional action that is required:
					<ul>
						<li>Not needed - i.e no additional action required.</li>
						<li>Status Message only - e-Mail notification summarising the readiness state of all associated TBS inputs.</li>
						<li>Provisional Deck with Status Message - include a Provisional deck containing all currently available input with the Status Message.</li>
					</ul>
						Choosing either of the last two options opens an additional dialog to allow you to
						specify the timing and how frequently you want your Provisional deck and/or
						status message updates to be delivered.
						<ol>
							<li><strong>Daily/weekly</strong>, select the desired
								weekday(s) - use the Ctrl key to select multiple days if you
								wish to receive more than one update.</li>
							<li><strong>Monthly</strong>, select the day of each month.</li>
						</ol>
					<li><strong>Desired time</strong>: Select the time (GMT) at
						which you would like to receive the status e-Mail in the event that
						the deck has not been created. A message will not be sent if a <strong>Final</strong>
						deck has been produced within the previous 24 hours. This time is
						also used as the trigger for the <strong>Provisional</strong> deck
						to be produced if requested.</li>
					<li><strong>Expiration date</strong>: Click in the <strong>Expiration
							date</strong> box and then select the date at which you will no longer
						require this deck to be created. A warning e-Mail will be sent in
						advance of this date to prompt you to extend the date, if desired,
						using the function enabled in the <strong>My Autodeck
							schedules</strong> page.</li>

				</div> <br />
				<div>
					<strong>Note</strong> that this tab only appears after the Autodeck
					has been successfully created for the first time. <br> <br>
					The <strong>Configuration template</strong> tab displays specific
					range selections for each slide or worksheet in your generated
					Autodeck. It provides a series of options to allow you to fine-tune
					each 'page' of the generated content. These are particularly useful
					for PowerPoint decks where the entire data range in each of your
					selected inputs will by default be shrunk to fit the slide and may
					need some adjustments before it can be read easily. A short
					description of the function of each column may be viewed by placing
					the mouse pointer on the column heading. A <strong>preview</strong>
					option allows you to quickly review the impact of your changes on a
					single input row without creating the entire Autodeck.<br> <br>
					To modify the content you must first click on the <strong>Edit
						template</strong> button. You will then be able to:
					<ul>
						<li><strong><u>Move up</u> </strong> or <strong><u>Move
									down</u> </strong>: use these links to adjust the sequence of your Autodeck
							pages by selecting the relevant Request ID(s) and clicking on the
							relevant 'action' link. Note that this sequence overrides the
							default order specified on the <strong>Edit requests</strong>
							tab.</li>
						<li><strong>Range</strong>: use this field to update the
							selected cells or chart from the specified <strong>Worksheet</strong>
							in the associated input file that is to be placed on the slide or
							worksheet. For example: 'B2:K24' would limit the data shown on
							the output page to the content between cells B2 and K24;
							'CHART:Chart 1' would select the graphic named Chart 1 from the
							designated Excel worksheet.</li>
						<li><strong><u>Delete</u> </strong>: remove unwanted content
							entirely by selecting the Request ID and clicking on this link.</li>
						<li><strong>Hide rows</strong> / <strong>Hide
								columns</strong>: hide specific rows or columns by entering the row
							numbers or column identifiers, separated by a comma, in the
							relevant fields. Note that you also may specify ranges using a
							colon separator. For example, A:D,G would remove columns A,B,C,D
							and G from your output page.</li>
						<li><strong>AutoSize rows</strong>: set rows to their maximum
							height by setting this field to <strong>YES</strong>.</li>
						<li><strong>AutoSize columns</strong>: set all columns to
							their maximum width by setting this field to <strong>YES</strong>.</li>
						<li><strong>Custom column format</strong>: use this field to
							modify column widths and cell alignment in your generated
							Autodeck. Specify the column identifier, its requested width and
							horizontal alignment in this field, using the format <i>'identifier
								(or range), width, alignment'</i>, separating each set of parameters
							with a semicolon. The cell alignment parameter (L - Left, C -
							Central, R - Right) is optional and will use the default value if
							not explicitly specified. For example, 'A:D,5.2,L;G,R;H,20' will
							left-justify columns A, B, C and D with a width of 5.2, will
							right-justify column G with its default width and will set column
							H to a custom width of 20 using its default cell alignment
							setting. Note that the 'width' is the column width you see when
							you right-click on the column identifier in Excel and must be in
							the range 0-255.</li>
						<li><strong>Custom row format</strong>: use this field to
							modify the row heights and cell alignment that appear in your
							generated Autodeck. Specify the row identifier, its requested
							height and vertical alignment in the field, using the format <i>'identifier
								(or range), width, alignment'</i>, separating each set of parameters
							with a semicolon. The cell alignment parameter (T - Top, M -
							Middle, B - Bottom) is optional and will use the default value if
							not explicitly specified. For example, '1:5,5.2,T;10,M;12,20'
							will top-align the text in rows 1,2,3,4 and 5 with a custom row
							height of 5.2, will center the text vertically in row 10 and will
							set row 12 to a custom row height of 20 with its default vertical
							cell alignment setting. Note that the 'height' is the row height
							you see when you right-click on the row identifier in Excel and
							must be in the range 0-409.</li>
						<li><strong>Wrap text in rows</strong>: use this field to
							request that the corresponding content spans multiple rows in the
							generated Autodeck. Select the candidate rows by entering the row
							numbers separated by commas or in range format (e.g. 1,5,7,9:15).</li>
						<li><strong>Merge</strong> (append) selected input on a
							single page:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>For PowerPoint: manually set the <strong>Slide
									No.</strong> to the same value. All associated inputs will be placed one
								after the other (vertically) on the same slide.
							</li>
							<li>For Excel: set the <strong>New worksheet name</strong>
								to be same value (max 31 characters). All associated inputs will
								be placed one after the other (vertically) on the same
								worksheet.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<li><strong>Display gridline</strong>: show table gridlines
							on your output by setting this field to <strong>YES</strong>.</li>
						<li><strong><u>Add one</u> </strong>: use this 'action' link
							to append a new input to your generated Autodeck. The system will
							create a Request ID record for you to modify by copying the top
							item in your Configuration template and placing it at the bottom
							of the list. Note that great care must be taken when editing the
							required fields to avoid any errors that could cause the Autodeck
							process to fail. It is highly recommended that you copy / paste
							the Request ID and Worksheet name to minimise the risk of such
							errors.</li>
					</ul>
					<strong>Please note</strong> that the AutoSize, Custom column
					format and Wrap text options will be applied in sequence. <br>
					<br> For PowerPoint decks only, you may also:
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Header text</strong>: use this field (max 128
							characters) to add a chart title (i.e. headline) to your chosen
							slide.</li>
						<li><strong>Blank slide</strong>: you may insert a blank
							slide in your Autodeck by entering 00000000 (eight zeroes) in the
							<strong>Request ID</strong> field and the desired blank page
							number in the <strong>Slide No.</strong> field. No other fields
							are needed although you may wish to add a chart title in the <strong>Header
								text</strong> field.</li>
						<li><strong><u>Renumber slides</u></strong>: use this link to
							reset the slide numbers sequentially after completing your edits.
							(Be careful if you have previously configured your deck to show
							two reports on the same slide as this function will cause them to
							appear on separate pages.)</li>
					</ul>
				</div> <br />
				<div>
					After making all required updates, click on the <strong>Submit</strong>
					button to save your changes and then close the window. <strong>If
						you want to cancel your updates, you must not press the Submit
						button as once it has been pressed all previous updates will be
						overridden.</strong> <br> <br> <strong>Other functions</strong>
					<ul>
						<li><strong><u>Generate preview</strong></u>: this link can
							be found on the right hand side of each row in the <strong>Configuration
								template</strong> when in <strong>Edit template</strong> mode. It can be
							used to evaluate the impact of the changes you have made on that
							single row. Please note that the chart header will <strong>not
								be included</strong> in this process and that it will take a few minutes
							to complete. You must wait for this to finish before being able
							to view the results by clicking on the <strong><u>Show
									preview</strong></u> link.</li>
						<li><strong>Request reset: </strong>if you need to regenerate
							the Configuration template with its system default values, click
							on the <strong>Request reset</strong> button but note that <strong>this
								action will take effect only after Autodeck configuration is
								reprocessed.</strong> You may also use the <strong><u>Restore
									template</u> </strong> link to recover the last saved set of system default
							values - this will be the template that was generated when the
							deck was first created unless you have subsequently submitted a <strong>Request
								reset</strong>.</li>
						<li><strong>Export/Import template: </strong>the <strong>Export
								template</strong> button allows you to create a local Excel copy of the
							current <strong>Configuration template</strong>. You will be
							presented with a browser pop-up window giving you the option to <strong>Open</strong>
							or <strong>Save</strong> the file. The <strong>Save</strong>
							option will save the file to your browser downloads directory
							using its system-generated name; the <strong>Open</strong> option
							allows you to subsequently save the file to any directory with a
							name of your own choosing. Note that users of Internet Explorer
							will be offered a <strong>Save as</strong> option which provides
							the equivalent function without first opening the file in Excel.
							The saved template may be used to replace the current
							configuration by clicking on the <strong>Import template</strong>
							button. You may also use this local copy to make changes to the
							Autodeck configuration but you are <strong>strongly
								advised to keep a back-up copy of the original and to take
								extreme care with your manual edits, as any errors may cause the
								Autodeck to fail once it is re-imported.</strong></li>
