	The <strong>My recent TBS outputs</strong> page provides a simple
	interface to allow you to download one or more of the most recent
	Cognos output files from your Trigger Based Schedules. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
	The page provides a tabular view of each of your Cognos Schedule
	Requests showing the following information: &nbsp;<br>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Report Name</strong> - the name of the Cognos report
			that has been scheduled.</li>
		<li><strong>e-Mail Subject</strong> - the information specified
			in your CSR as the e-Mail subject. Note that this is also the
			filename of the downloaded report output.</li>
		<li><strong>Frequency</strong> - the schedule frequency
			information for this request</li>
		<li><strong>Datamart / Data Load</strong> - the name of the data
			load used to trigger this schedule request</li>
		<li><strong>Comments</strong> - the additional information
			provided in your CSR to help distinguish multiple schedule requests
			for the same report name.</li>
		<li><strong>Last Run Date</strong> - the date on which this
			request was run.</li>
		<li><strong>Domain</strong> - shows the Cognos domain where this
			CSR was run.</li>
		<li><strong>Owner</strong> - - flag indicating whether you are
			the owner (Y) or the designated Back-up (B) for this Cognos Schedule
			Request.</li>
		<li><strong>Action</strong> - link allowing you to <strong>Download</strong>
			the output file if it is still available on the system. Note that
			output files will only be kept on the system for a maximum of two
			weeks and will be flagged as <strong>Not Available</strong> after
			this time.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		You may also use the check boxes alongside each CSR to select multiple
		output files and then download them all as a single action by clicking
		on the <strong>Download all Selected</strong> button. If you want all
		available output files, you may click on the checkbox alongside the
		table column headings to select all rows. Note that the unique <strong>Request
			ID</strong> will be appended to the e-Mail subject to help you distinguish
		multiple outputs with what would otherwise be the same name. If you
		wish to avoid this situation, please ensure that you use unique e-Mail
		subjects across all of your Cognos Schedule Requests.
