			</div>
			<br />
			<div>
				The <strong>Cognos Schedule</strong> panel allows you to create new
				Cognos Schedule Requests based on a series of event triggers (e.g.
				data availability) or modify those you have created earlier. The
				panel opens in a new browser window when you click the <strong>Schedule
					This Report</strong> icon for a schedule-enabled Cognos report or when you
				click on the <strong>Report Name</strong> link from the <strong>My
					Cognos Schedules</strong> page. Step-by-step instructions are provided and
				can be 'toggled' on and off by clicking on the <strong>'Show
					instructions | Hide instructions'</strong> text. (Note that these schedules
				are separate from the time-based scheduling supported by the native
				Cognos product.)
			</div>
			<br />
			<div>
				The panel opens to the Edit prompts tab and also displays the Output
				format, e-Mail information, Schedule and Schedule history tabs.<br />
				Once the schedule has been set up, you may select a <strong>Priority</strong>
				to control the sequence in which <strong>your</strong> schedules are
				executed. The order of execution for a given trigger is:
				<ol>
					<li>High priority requests</li>
					<li>Medium priority requests</li>
					<li>Low priority requests</li>
					<li>Off-peak requests</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					<strong>Note that Off-peak requests will be run when
						system resources allow them to complete without impacting the
						delivery of higher priority requests.</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					For reports that are configured to use the BI@IBM TBS <strong>Report
						Chaining</strong> function, additional <strong>Chained report
						controls</strong> options will be offered. These three settings allow you
					to control the run-time execution of the parent and child reports
					as follows:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Run Parent and Child report</strong> - both
						schedule requests will be run (this is the default setting)</li>
					<li><strong>Do not run/create Child report</strong> - only the
						Parent report schedule request will be run</li>
					<li><strong>Do not run Parent report</strong> - only the Child
						report schedule request will be run</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Before saving the updated schedule request by clicking on the <strong>Submit</strong>
					button, you may also ask for the report to be <strong>Run
						now</strong>. Simply click on the checkbox to add your request to the
					processing queue where it will execute irrespective of whether the
					trigger has been set that day or the specified schedule timing
					information. Note that if the schedule request was previously in <strong>Inactive</strong>
					state, the <strong>Run now</strong> request will reset it to <strong>Active</strong>.
				</p>
				<p>Other functions include the ability to:
				<ul>
					<li>View any <strong>Existing schedules</strong> (My Cognos
						schedules page),
					</li>
					<li><strong>Create another schedule</strong> for the selected
						report.</li>
					<li><strong>Copy this schedule</strong> for yourself or for
						another BI@IBM user. Please note that all new copies for yourself
						will be set to <strong>Suspend</strong> state and will not execute
						until you update the selected prompts. Copies for another BI@IBM
						user will be set to <strong>Inactive</strong> state and will not
						execute until the recipient sets it to <strong>Active</strong>
						again.</li>
				</ul>

				<div>
					The <strong>e-Mail information</strong> tab is used to specify the
					recipient information for your Cognos schedule request. <br>Complete
					the following fields:
				</div>
				<br />
				<ul>
					<li><strong>e-Mail address</strong>: This is a required field.
						You can type the e-Mail intranet address for up to 12 recipients
						separated by spaces. You may use a combination of individual IDs
						and any report distribution lists you have already set up using
						the <strong>Report distribution lists</strong> link in the <strong>Resource
							center</strong> portlet.<br> &nbsp;</li>
					<li><strong>e-Mail subject</strong>: This is a required field.
						Type the text to display in the subject line of the e-Mail. If you
						do not enter text, the report name displays by default. <strong>Note</strong>:
						It is recommended that you use this field to make it easy to
						identify this specific request in your mail.<br> &nbsp;</li>
					<li><strong>e-Mail comments:</strong> This is an optional
						field. Type comments about the report that you want to include in
						the body of the e-Mail message.<br> &nbsp;</li>
					<li><strong>Backup:</strong> This is an optional field and may
						be used to enter the intranet ID of another BI@IBM users who be
						given edit access to this schedule request. Note that this status
						is indicated in the backup owner's <strong>My Cognos
							schedules</strong> page by a <strong> 'B'</strong> in the <strong>Owner</strong>
						column.<br>&nbsp;</li>
					<li><strong>Mail options:</strong> These selections allow you
						to determine if the report output is to be e-Mailed to its target
						recipients or just left on the system server for use in Autodeck
						processing. If the e-Mail option is selected, additional <strong>Mail
							type</strong> options determine whether the output file itself is to be
						included in the e-Mail message and/or whether a link (url) to the
						report is preferred.<br> The <strong>Show SMS SOM
							Support Team</strong> setting modifies the e-Mail subject line and
						content, and is intended to be used in those circumstances when
						the SMS team has scheduled the report on behalf of their
						stakeholder. If the <strong>Yes</strong> option is selected, the <strong>Requested
							by</strong> section of the e-Mail subject line is replaced by the text <strong>"Scheduled
							on your behalf by the SMS SOM Support Team"</strong> and a link is added
						to the Support Team application in place of the default link
						enabling the owner to edit the related Cognos Schedule Request.<br>
						The final mail option determines whether or not any selected
						output file should be sent in compressed format (i.e. zip file). <br>
						&nbsp;</li>
					<li><strong>Notify errors?:</strong> Regardless of the
						selected <strong>Send mail</strong> option, you may choose to
						receive e-Mail notifications of any associated schedule processing
						errors.</li>

					The <strong>Schedule tab</strong> is used to specify the event

					fields:
				</div>
				<br />

					<li><strong>Schedule frequency</strong>: Different options are
						presented for different trigger types - select the option most
						appropriate to your needs:</li>
					<br>
					<ul>

						<ul>
							<li>Weekly - will run as soon as the requested weekly data
								is available.</li>
							<li>Selected day of the week - will run on the selected day
								if the data is available; if not the schedule will wait for that
								week's data trigger.</li>
							<li>Monthly - will run on the selected day(s) of the month
								using the then available weekly data.</li>
							<li>Business event - will run as soon as the designated
								event occurs using the then available weekly data. This is
								useful for the reports such as the QSAI reports that are only
								required at specific times during the business cycle.</li>
						</ul>
						<li><strong>Daily Triggers</strong></li>
						<ul>
							<li>Daily - will run using close of business data for the
								selected day(s).</li>
							<li>Monthly - will run using close of business data for the
								selected day(s) of the month.</li>
						</ul>
						<li><strong>NRT Triggers</strong></li>
						<ul>
							<li>Not applicable - report will only be run when the <strong>Run
									now</strong> option is selected.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<li><strong>Data load timing</strong>: Select the data load
						update trigger for this schedule request. (Note that this option
						is not applicable for NRT report schedule requests.)<br>
						&nbsp;</li>
					<li><strong>Expiration date</strong>: Specify when the report
						schedule expires - the date will default to the maximum allowed
						for the selected schedule frequency. You will be prompted to
						extend the Expiration date before the schedule is set to
						'Inactive' in case you still need it to run. (Note that this
						option is not applicable to NRT report schedule requests.)<br>
