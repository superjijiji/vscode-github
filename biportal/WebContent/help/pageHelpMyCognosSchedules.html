<div>
	The
	<strong>My Cognos schedules</strong> page enables you to manage the Cognos trigger-based report schedules that you have created.
	&nbsp;
</div>
<br />

<p>
	Open the page by clicking on
	<strong>My Cognos schedules</strong> in the
	<strong>BI@IBM controls</strong> portlet. A series of links are provided in the left hand navigation panel to allow you to invoke
	other BI@IBM functions. These links enable:
	<ul>
		<li>Easy access to the BI@IBM
			<strong>My Autodecks</strong> and
			<strong>My distribution lists</strong> pages.
		</li>
		<li>Reporting of the overall BI@IBM
			<strong>TBS execution status
			</strong> across all data load triggers and Cognos domains.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Direct publication</strong> of Cognos Schedule outputs to the BI@IBM Report Library. Note that this function is enabled
			for
			<strong>Authorised users only</strong>.</li>
		<li>Working with the associated Cognos Schedule Requests
			<strong>By Autodeck</strong>. A new panel will allow you to select the Autodeck whose schedules you then wish to work with.
			<br>&nbsp;
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<strong>The Information Display</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		The My Cognos schedules page opens to the
		<strong>All my schedules
		</strong> view. If you have created folders to help manage your Cognos Schedule Requests (see Manage folders below), the
		folder names will be shown immediately below this default link in the left hand navigator. Clicking on a folder name will
		limit the information displayed to that subset of your request portfolio.
	</p>
	<p>The information that is displayed can be customised by using the <strong>Show/Hide columns</strong> button.
	Note that the Checkbox, Report Name, Run Status and Run Date columns cannot be hidden.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Report Name</strong> - provides a link to the Cognos schedule request. To change the settings for a schedule, click the
			link in the <strong>Report Name</strong> field. This action opens the saved
			<strong>Cognos schedule request</strong> page for that report where you can modify the schedule settings. When your changes are
			complete, click on <strong>Submit</strong> to save your changes and return.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>e-Mail Subject</strong> - shows the text that will appear as the Subject line when the report output is mailed to its
			target recipients.</li>
		<li>
			<strong>e-Mail Address</strong> - shows the list of recipients for the report output.</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Comments</strong> - text added as comments on the edit prompts page when you set the schedule request up. This is intended
			to help you distinguish between multiple schedules for the same report.
			<br>
			<strong>Note:</strong> if you see the text
			<strong>(System Generated Schedule)</strong> appended to the comment text, this implies that the schedule request has been automatically
			created for you using the prompts and other schedule execution parameters that you defined on an associated
			<strong>parent</strong> report. This
			<strong>TBS Chaining
			</strong> feature is normally used when a summary report has related detail section that has been designed as a separate
			report for performance reasons. The
			<strong>System Generated Schedule</strong>
			will be recreated and rerun using the latest execution parameters every time that the
			<strong>parent</strong> report is triggered unless you specifically disable it by setting it to
			<strong>
				Inactive</strong> or update the
			<strong>Chained report controls</strong>
			options within the
			<strong>parent</strong> report schedule request.</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Frequency</strong> - shows the days of the week that the schedule
			<strong>can</strong> be triggered. Note that the report will only run on these days regardless of when the trigger is actually
			received.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Data Load</strong> - the chosen data load trigger and its current status. OK (green text) means the data source is online
			and available for schedules to be run; NO (red text) means the data source is currently unavailable.</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Expiration Date</strong> - the last date this schedule request can be run. Note that you will be prompted to extend the
			Expiration date before the schedule is set to 'Inactive' in case you still need it to run.</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Status</strong> - shows whether the request is Active, Inactive, Suspended, Disabled or Expired. An additional (C) designation
			indicates that the request is a system generated
			<strong>Chained</strong>
			report. The Active/Inactive status is under user control whereas Expired, Suspended and Disabled are determined by system
			Administrators. Schedule requests may be temporarily Suspended from TBS execution because of report design changes that
			require prompts to be reselected. Once the prompts are updated, the CSR may be set to Active again. They may be Disabled
			because the reports are no longer available on the system. In this latter case you should select the designated CSRs and
			click the
			<strong>Delete</strong> button to remove the associated Cognos Schedule Requests.</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Send Mail</strong> - shows whether the request output is to be mailed to its target recipients (Y) or not sent at all
			(N).</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Priority</strong> - shows the
			<strong>relative</strong>
			execution priority of the request within your portfolio of Cognos schedules.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Owner</strong> - indicates if you are the <strong>Owner</strong> of the schedule request or are the designated <strong>Backup</strong>.</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Run Status</strong> - shows the completion status code from the last attempt to run the schedule. Note that successes
			(codes 100 and 101) are shown in green whereas error codes are displayed in red text.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>100 - Report ran successfully.</li>
			<li>101 - Report ran and sent out mail successfully.</li>
			<li>111 - Report ran successfully but the report output is no longer available for download.</li>
			<li>200 - Report failed to run successfully.</li>
			<li>300 - Report is running.</li>
			<li>400 - Timeout</li>
		</ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Run Date</strong> - shows the date when the schedule was last run.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<strong>Notes:</strong> Clicking on any of the column headings will sort the displayed information alphabetically. Clicking on
		that column header again will switch the display order. An icon will appear next to the column heading to indicate whether
		this is in ascending or descending order.
	</p>
	<p>
		The
		<strong>Search</strong> box allows you to locate the subset of displayed requests that match your search criterion. The display
		will update dynamically as you enter a text string (2 or more characters) and will display only those requests that contain
		the designated text.
