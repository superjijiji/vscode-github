<div>
	The
	<strong>Add/remove Control Books</strong> page enables you to configure the set of Control Books that are available for selection in the My control books portlet.
	&nbsp;
</div>
<br />

	<p>Open the page by clicking on the <strong>Add/remove control books</strong> link from the
	<strong>My control books</strong> portlet.
	There are two sections on the page:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Selected control books</strong> - this section shows those control books have already been selected to appear in your
		My control books list.
		Click on the checkbox to select any that you no longer require and then click on the <strong>Remove</strong> button.
		Please note that any control book that has been selected for you by the Control Book Administrator cannot be removed by this process.
		Please contact the support contact identified in the control book help document to request removal if you no longer have need of these reports.
		</li>
		<li><strong>Add control books</strong> - this section helps you locate the control books you want to access.
		Simply select the ones you want and then click on the <strong>Add</strong> button.
		You can locate the control books you want to work with by using the <strong>Geography</strong> or
		<strong>Business</strong> filters, or simply scroll down to browse the available entries.
		The <strong>info</strong> icon associated with each control book opens up a new window with additional
		information to help you confirm your selections.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Please note that although the selected control books will appear in the <strong>
	My control books</strong> portlet immediately, the reports will appear with a
	<strong>padlock</strong> symbol until the BI@IBM security program has confirmed
	your entitlement to use that report and see the associated data.
	The control book help document provides details of how to request access if you do not already
	have the requirement entitlement.</p>
