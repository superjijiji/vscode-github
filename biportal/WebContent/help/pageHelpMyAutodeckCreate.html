			<li><strong>Zip output</strong>. Click to the radio button to
				determin if the output file should be compressed</li>
			<li><strong>Append date</strong> Select this option if you wish
				to append date information to the file name to help distinguish
				weekly Autodeck outputs. If you select this option you will be asked
				to choose from one of the provided date information formats. <strong>Note</strong>
				that the week number and quarter used in this process are determined
				by the data currency information provided in the ESA Weekly tables
				following the <strong>AP data update cycle</strong>.</li>
			<li><strong>Autodeck inputs</strong>. Click on this link to
				pick your required deck content from the portfolio of active Cognos
				schedule requests that you have set up and any xls/xlsx files that
				you have uploaded.
				The current readiness state is provided in the <strong>Output Status</strong> and
				<strong>Last Ready Time</strong> information that is shown for each of the TBS inputs you select.
				Choose the reports in the order you wish them to
				appear, or use the checkboxes alongside each of your selected
				requests and then adjust the page order as needed by clicking on the
				<strong>Up</strong> or <strong>Down</strong> links before clicking
				on <strong>OK</strong> to return.</li>
			<br>&nbsp;
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li>Complete the requested e-Mail information:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>e-Mail address</strong>: This is a required field.
				You can type the intranet style e-Mail address for up to 12
				recipients.</li>
			<li><strong>Subject</strong>: This is a required field. Type the
				text to display in the subject line of the e-Mail.<br> <strong>Note</strong>:
				It is recommended that you use this field to make it easy to
				identify this Autodeck request in your mail.</li>
			<li><strong>e-Mail content:</strong> This is an optional field.
				Type information about the presentation deck that you want to
				include in the body of the e-Mail message.</li>
			<li><strong>Backup</strong>: Specify the intranet ID of the user
				who you want to act as the backup owner (editor) of this Autodeck
				definition. This is an optional field.</li>
			<br>&nbsp;
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li><strong>Final deck Synchronisation</strong>:
						Your Autodeck will be created as soon as all the criteria for the Autodeck creation have been met.
						The requested inputs must be available and have been updated since the specified day / time (Weekly Autodecks)
						or since the last <strong>Final</strong> deck was produced (Daily Autodecks).
						Note that xls uploads are not checked for updates and will be used in their current state as soon as all
						other inputs are available.
						If the schedule output is no longer available to be used the associated Cognos Schedule must be rerun (normal schedule or Run now action)
						or removed before the Autodeck can be produced.<br><br>
						Choose from one of the following two options to control the timing of your <strong>Final</strong> Autodeck creation:
						<ol>
							<li><strong>Day/Time</strong> - the Autodeck will be created
							when all required inputs are updated <strong>again AFTER</strong> the chosen day and time.
							<br>
							<strong>Note: This is the recommended option for Weekly Autodecks and is now the default for all newly created Autodeck schedules.
							For weekly cadence reports you should choose 'Wednesday' and a time a few hours prior to earliest update time for the data your
							reports rely on.</li></strong><br>
							<li><strong>When Ready</strong> - the Autodeck will be created
							when all required inputs are <strong>NEXT</strong> updated, regardless of when that happens.
							<br>
							<strong>Important notes for option #2 (When Ready): </strong>
							<ul>
							<li>Until the Autodeck has been generated at least once, the only available readiness states are 'Ready' and 'Unavailable' -
							the additional 'Not Ready' designation can only appear after the generation process has completed.
							As such, this additional information will only be shown
							in the <strong>Edit requests</strong> tab of the <strong>Existing Autodecks</strong> pages.</li>
							<li>If your Autodeck relies on content that is scheduled to be produced
							on different days of the week, you need to be very careful about
							the day you initially submit your request, as this will determine
							when subsequent decks are created. For example, consider a simple
							deck that uses an input (A) created on a Tuesday and another (B)
							that is created on Thursday each week. If the user wants the
							Autodeck to contain information from the same week, the schedule
							should be submitted after report B has been updated and before
							report A is re-triggered (e.g. on Friday). If the deck was created
							between the refresh cycles of reports A and B (e.g. on Wednesday),
							the Autodeck would always contain the current week content for
							report A and the prior week content for report B.</li>
							<li>The <strong>Reset Output Status</strong> function on the Edit Requests tab of your Existing Autodeck definitions
							allows you correct this and resync the TBS inputs by toggling
							between the <strong>Ready</strong> and <strong>Not Ready</strong> states for the selected TBS input(s) if necessary.</li>
							</li>
						</ol>
			<br>&nbsp;
		</ul></li>
		<li><strong>Status Messages / Provisional Decks</strong>: Use the menu selection list to control any additional action that is required:
			<ul>
				<li>Not needed - i.e no additional action required.</li>
				<li>Status Message only - e-Mail notification summarising the readiness state of all associated TBS inputs.</li>
				<li>Provisional Deck with Status Message - include a Provisional deck containing all currently available input with the Status Message.</li>
			</ul>
			Choosing either of the last two options opens an additional dialog to allow you to
			specify the timing and how frequently you want your Provisional deck and/or
			status message updates to be delivered.
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Daily/weekly</strong>, select the desired
				weekday(s) - use the Ctrl key to select multiple days if you
				wish to receive more than one update.</li>
				<li><strong>Monthly</strong>, select the day of each month.</li>
			</ol>
			<li><strong>Desired time</strong>: Select the time (GMT) at
			which you would like to receive the status e-Mail in the event that
			the deck has not been created. A message will not be sent if a <strong>Final</strong>
			deck has been produced within the previous 24 hours. This time is
			also used as the trigger for the <strong>Provisional</strong> deck
			to be produced if requested.</li>
		<li><strong>Expiration date</strong>: Click in the <strong>Expiration
		date</strong> box and then select the date at which you will no longer
		require this deck to be created. A warning e-Mail will be sent in
		advance of this date to prompt you to extend the date if desired
		using the function enabled in the <strong>My Autodeck schedules</strong> page.</li>
		</ul>
